                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm a software engineer primarily focused on Android Development and Quality Assurance. I am extremely familiar with Kotlin, Android Jetpack, Android Compose, and Espresso. On the QA side of things, I have extensive experience in writing automated tests in Selenium, Protractor, Cypress, and Playwright, in a variety of languages. I also have experience writing API tests, performing manual testing, as well as building extensive testing tools to automate testing further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my professional life, I enjoy working on and building things. Whether that is repairing walkmans and other cassette players, building mechanical keyboards, or writing Android Apps for my favorite games, I'm always tinkering on something. Lately I've been working on my audio setup so I can dub and label cassettes, and I'm hoping to add MiniDiscs to that.
                    </p>
                    <p> I also love to wind down by listening to my cassette collection while drinking tea or knitting. </p>

                            Responsible for designing and developing Automated Regression Tests using Selenium for new features on Fidelity’s website. Built a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and RESTful APIs during down time to better accomplish my assigned tasks. Worked in two week sprints alongside a development team and participated in daily stand-up meetings.
